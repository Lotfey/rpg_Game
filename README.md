System design of a simple RPG game in C++ from scratch. The implementation is going to be logic and turn-based, so there is no 3D rendering or animation involved. The sole purpose of this project is to work with almost every C++ element for software development such as software design, architecture, classes, and inheritance ... 

## Design in mind 

Some quick theoretical lists to get started 

### Classes 

	- Warrior: HP growth 19: highest damage reduction 
	- Wizard: HP growth 9: use magic
	- Cleric: HP growth 14: use support magic
	- Rogue: HP Growth 14:highest consistent melee/ ranged damage

### Leveling system
	- Get stats based on classes
	- Gain abilities based on level

### Equipements 
	- Shop System	
	- Equipements
	- Consumables

### Game loop
	- Battle system: turn-based
	- World levels 
	- Different monsters 
		
the design may change along the coding ...
